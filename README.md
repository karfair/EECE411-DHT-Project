# EECE411 DHT Project
group2

The project was to build a decentralized distributed key-value store (a DHT) based on consistent hashing. The client can contact any of the nodes via UDP to perform a get, put, or remove operation. The DHT is to be deployed on 100 or more PlanetLab nodes.

See the [final report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xi_Nxw_EoFHcXSTg-QIMhGEcnpf37OB3zbgBJOBfO0/edit?usp=sharing) for additional information on the system.

See https://github.com/SteveQiu/PlanetlabDeployProgram for the PlanetLab deployment code.

Built/compiled files and deployment files are also available under the `final` folder.
