# EECE411 DHT Project
group2

The project was to build a decentralized distributed key-value store (a DHT) based on consistent hashing. The client can contact any of the nodes via UDP to perform a get, put, or remove operation. The DHT is to be deployed on 100 or more PlanetLab nodes.

See [[final/EECE411.2015.A3.html]] for the project description.
See the final report for additional information on the system.

Built / Compiled files and deployment files are located under the [final] folder.
